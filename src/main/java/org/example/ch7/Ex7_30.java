(Pattern recognition: consecutive four equal numbers) Write the following method
that tests whether the array has four consecutive numbers with the same value:

public static boolean isConsecutiveFour(int[] values)

Write a test program that prompts the user to enter a series of integers and dis-
plays it if the series contains four consecutive numbers with the same value. Your
program should first prompt the user to enter the input sizeâ€”i.e., the number of
values in the series.
