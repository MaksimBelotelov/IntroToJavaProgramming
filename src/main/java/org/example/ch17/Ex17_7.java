(Restore objects from a file) Suppose a file named Exercise17_06.dat has
been created using the ObjectOutputStream from the preceding program-
ming exercises. The file contains Loan objects. The Loan class in Listing 10.2
does not implement Serializable. Rewrite the Loan class to implement
Serializable. Write a program that reads the Loan objects from the file and
displays the total loan amount. Suppose that you donâ€™t know how many Loan
objects are there in the file, use EOFException to end the loop.
