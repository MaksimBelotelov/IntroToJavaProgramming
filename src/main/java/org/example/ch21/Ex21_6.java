/*
(Count the occurrences of numbers entered) Write a program that reads an
unspecified number of integers and finds the one that has the most occur-
rences. The input ends when the input is 0. For example, if you entered 2
3 40 3 5 4 â€“3 3 3 2 0, the number 3 occurred most often. If not one but
several numbers have the most occurrences, all of them should be reported.
For example, since 9 and 3 appear twice in the list 9 30 3 9 3 2 4, both occur-
rences should be reported.
